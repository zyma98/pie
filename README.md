**Pie** is a high-performance, programmable LLM serving system that empowers you to design and deploy custom inference logic and optimization strategies.

> **Note** 🧪
>
> This software is in a **pre-release** stage and under active development. It's recommended for testing and research purposes only.



## Getting Started

### Installation

**Option 1: PyPI**

```bash
pip install "pie-server[cuda]"   # Linux/Windows
pip install "pie-server[metal]"  # macOS
```

**Option 2: Build from Source (Recommended)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pie-project/pie.git && cd pie/pie

# Recommended: use uv to sync (options: cu126, cu128, cu130, metal)
uv sync --extra cu128
```

### Quick Start

Run a test prompt (you will be prompted for configuration and model download if this is your first time):

```bash
pie run text-completion -- --prompt "Hello world!"
```

> **Note:** The first run may take longer due to JIT compilation.
> *If built from source, prefix commands with `uv run` (e.g., `uv run pie config init`).*
