# Writing Inferlets

:::caution Work in Progress
This documentation is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive guides on writing inferlets.
:::

Inferlets are lightweight WebAssembly programs that define custom inference logic in Pie. They give you fine-grained control over the generation process—tokenization, sampling, KV cache management, and more.

## Overview

Inferlets can be written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly:
- **Rust** (recommended)
- **Python** (via Pie SDK)
- **Go**
- **C/C++**

## Coming Soon

- Getting started guide
- API reference
- Example inferlets
- Best practices
- Debugging tips

## In the Meantime

Check out the [Overview](./overview/index.mdx) page for a high-level understanding of how inferlets fit into the Pie architecture, including a code example.
